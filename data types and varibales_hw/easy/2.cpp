/*

A teacher want a program that reads 2 students information about math exam
	Read per student: name, id and grade
	Then print them. See the picture in the slides


Be a good software engineer
	Think deeply in your selected data types
	The teacher gives us this dialogue to guide us
	Be careful from your assumptions?
	Is examâ€™s grade an integer?
